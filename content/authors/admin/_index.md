I'm a junior undergrad majoring in CS & Math at UW Madison. Before transferred to Madison, I spent two wonderful years at the CS Department of University of Electronic Science & Technology of China. I love math and am experienced in competitive programming. My current research interests include scalable and efficient machine learning, distributed systems and databases.

I am applying for PhD programs starting from fall 2022. If you are interested, please take a look at my latest [resume](files/cv.pdf). For more personal projects, you can visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/fire-sale). Recently, I also begin to maintain a [website](https://gaofan.gitbook.io/paper-notes/) for notes of papers that I've read and plan to read.
